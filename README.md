# Sample Prolog

This is an example Prolog project used in Daytona.

2 differents Prolog environments are being installed:

- [GNU Prolog (`gprolog`)](http://www.gprolog.org/)
- [SWI-Prolog (`swipl`)](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Open Using Daytona  

1. **Install Daytona**: Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/).  
2. **Create the Workspace**:  
   ```bash  
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-prolog
   ```

3. Verify Prolog environment version

```bash
$ gprolog --version
Prolog top-Level (GNU Prolog) x.y.z
```

```bash  
$ swipl --version
SWI-Prolog version x.y.z for x86_64-linux
```

3. Open `main.pro` (in Visual Studio Code change bottom right "Plain Text" to "Prolog")
(this will be required until https://github.com/sazzledazzle/prolog-runner/issues/1 is not fixed)

Look at facts and rules which have been defined in `main.pro`.

4. **Start the Application as a script with `swipl`**:  

Create a new Terminal by pressing on "+"

Cick on "Run Prolog File" to execute this file.

It should run

```bash
$ swipl -q -f "/workspaces/sample-prolog/main.pro" -t halt.
```

and display

```
Test grandparent(john, ann): true
Test sibling(ann, pat): true
Test ancestor(john, jim): true
Mary's children: [ann,pat]
```

5. **Start the application as a script with gprolog**:

```bash
$ gprolog
GNU Prolog 1.4.5 (64 bits)

Test grandparent(john, ann): true
Test sibling(ann, pat): true
Test ancestor(john, jim): true
Mary's children: [ann,pat]

(4 ms) yes
```

Use CTRL+D to quit interpreter.

You can also run `main.pro` script like so:

```bash
$ gprolog --consult-file main.pro
```

6. Test `gprolog` or `swipl` as REPL (Read–eval–print loop).

Exemple with `gprolog`. Define facts and rules.

`/* ... */` are multiline comments and `% ...` after a command is a single comment.

```bash
$ gprolog
```
```prolog
| ?- /*
      Facts about parent relationships
      */
      assertz(parent(john, mary)). % john is parent of mary
yes
| ?- assertz(parent(john, tom)). % john is parent of tom
yes
| ?- assertz(parent(mary, ann)). % mary is parent of ann
yes
| ?- assertz(parent(mary, pat)). % mary is parent of pat
yes
| ?- assertz(parent(tom, jim)). % tom is parent of jim
yes
| ?- /*
      Rules
      */ assertz((grandparent(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z))). % X is grandparent of Z if X is parent of Y and Y is parent of Z
yes
| ?- assertz((sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \= Y)). % X is sibling of Y if they share a parent and are not the same person
yes
| ?- assertz((ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y))). % X is ancestor of Y if X is parent of Y
yes
| ?- assertz((ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y))). % or X is parent of someone who is ancestor of Y
yes
```

Puis les requêtes :
```prolog
| ?- grandparent(john, ann).
true ?

yes
| ?- sibling(ann, pat).
true ?

yes
| ?- ancestor(john, jim).

true ?

yes
| ?- findall(X, parent(mary, X), Children).

Children = [ann,pat]

(1 ms) yes
```

To quit interpreter :
```prolog
| ?- halt.
```

Similiar REPL usage can be done with SWI-Prolog but be aware that

```
?- asserta(parent(alice, bob)).  % adds at beginning
?- assertz(parent(carol, dave)). % adds at end
?- assert(parent(eve, frank)).   % same as assertz in SWI-Prolog
```

The order can matter because Prolog searches clauses in the order they were added, which can affect:

- Performance (earlier clauses are checked first)
- Results (when multiple solutions exist)
